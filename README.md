# Machine Learning: Model Validation

This repository contains a project focused on creating and validating machine learning models using vehicle sales history data. The dataset includes information on mileage, model year, price, and whether the vehicle was sold. The project's goal is to create a machine learning model to predict whether a car will be sold based on these variables. The process involves converting the data and creating multiple machine learning models with scikit-learn to demonstrate the importance of cross-validation, the influence of factors such as data randomness and stratification, and cross-validation models such as KFold, StratifiedKFold, and GroupKFold.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict car sales and explore various model validation techniques to ensure robust and reliable predictions.
